        <p>Carbon literacy is the knowledge and awareness about how carbon emissions affect the environment and what actions we can take to reduce them. Becoming carbon literate empowers individuals and organizations to make informed decisions that positively impact the planet.</p>

        <h3>Key Topics to Learn</h3>
        <ul>
         <li><strong>What is a Carbon Footprint?</strong></li>
            <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) that are generated by our actions. Understanding how activities like transportation, energy usage, and consumption contribute to our footprint is critical to reducing it.</p>
            
            <li><strong>The Science of Climate Change</strong></li>
            <p>Learn about the greenhouse effect, global warming, and how human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have accelerated climate change. Understanding these mechanisms is key to grasping why carbon reduction is vital.</p>
            
            <li><strong>How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint</strong></li>
            <p>Simple actions can lead to significant reductions in carbon emissions. Learn how to reduce energy consumption, shift to sustainable transportation, minimize waste, and make responsible consumption choices.</p>

            <li><strong>Why Sustainable Living Matters</strong></li>
            <p>Sustainable living not only reduces carbon emissions but also helps conserve resources for future generations. Learn how lifestyle changes can support sustainability goals.</p>

            <li><strong>Carbon Footprint of Organizations</strong></li>
            <p>Companies and organizations have a major role to play in reducing carbon footprints. Learn how businesses can adopt sustainable practices such as energy-efficient operations, eco-friendly supply chains, and waste reduction strategies.</p>
        </ul>
